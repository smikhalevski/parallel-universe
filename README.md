# `PubSub`

Publishâ€“subscribe pattern implementation that guarantees that published messages are delivered even if some subscribers
throw an error.

```ts
const pubSub = new PubSub<string>();

pubSub.subscribe(message => {
  message === 'Pluto' // â†’ true
});

pubSub.publish('Pluto');
```

`PubSub` can retain messages that were not processed. Message is considered not processed if all subscribers returned
`false`, or if there are no subscribers at all. You can pass a limit of retained messages to the constructor.

```ts
const pubSub = new PubSub<string>(100);

// ðŸŸ¡ Note that a message is published before a subscriber is added
pubSub.publish('Mars');

pubSub.subscribe(message => {
  message === 'Mars' // â†’ true
});
```

Retained messages are passed to the new subscriber when it is being subscribed for the first time. If the message wasn't
processed but the limit is reached, then the earliest message is removed and the published message is added.

# `AsyncQueue`

Asynchronous queue decouples value providers and value consumers.

```ts
const queue = new AsyncQueue();

// Provider adds a value
queue.add('Mars');

// Consumer takes a value
queue.take(); // â†’ Promise<'Mars'>
```

`add` appends the value to the queue, while `take` removes the value from the queue as soon as it is available. If there
are no values in the queue upon `take` call then the returned promise is resolved after the next `add` call.

```ts
const queue = new AsyncQueue();

// The returned promise would be resolved after the add call
queue.take(); // â†’ Promise<'Mars'>

queue.add('Mars');
```

Consumers receive values from the queue in the same order they were added by providers:

```ts
const queue = new AsyncQueue();

queue.add('Mars');
queue.add('Venus');

queue.take(); // â†’ Promise<'Mars'>
queue.take(); // â†’ Promise<'Venus'>
```

## Acknowledgements

In some cases removing the value from the queue isn't the desirable behavior, since the consumer may not be able to
process the taken value. Use `takeAck` to examine available value and acknowledge that it can be processed.

```ts
queue.takeAck().then(([value, ack]) => {
  if (doSomeChecks()) {
    ack();
    doSomething(value);
  }
});
```

`takeAck` returns a tuple of the available value and the acknowledgement callback. The consumer should call `ack` to
notify the queue on weather to remove the value from the queue or to retain it.

To acknowledge that the consumer can process the value, and the value must be removed from the queue use:

```ts
ack(); // or ack(true)
```

To acknowledge that the value should be retained by the queue use:

```ts
ack(false);
```

The value that was retained in the queue becomes available for the subsequent consumer.

```ts
const queue = new AsyncQueue();

queue.add('Pluto');

queue.takeAck(([value, ack]) => {
  ack(false); // Tells queue to retain the value
});

queue.take(); // â†’ Promise<'Pluto'>
```

## Blocking vs non-blocking acknowledgements

By default, if you didn't call `ack`, the acknowledgement would be automatically revoked on _the next tick_ after
the promise returned by `takeAck` is resolved, and the value would remain in the queue.

If acknowledgement was revoked, the `ack` call would throw an error:

```ts
queue.takeAck()
  .then(protocol => protocol) // Extra tick
  .then(([value, ack]) => {
    ack(); // Throws an error
  });
```

To prevent the acknowledgement from being revoked, request a blocking acknowledgement:

```ts
queue.takeAck(true) // Request a blocking ack
  .then(protocol => protocol) // Extra tick
  .then(([value, ack]) => {
    ack(); // Value acknowledged
    doSomething(value);
  });
```

Blocking acknowledgement is required if the consumer has to perform asynchronous actions before processing the value.

To guarantee that consumers receive values in the same order as they were provided, blocking acknowledgements prevent
subsequent consumers from being resolved until `ack` is called. Be sure to call `ack` to prevent the queue from being
stuck indefinitely.

```ts
async function blockingConsumer() {
  const [value, ack] = queue.takeAck(true);

  try {
    if (await doSomeChecks()) {
      ack(true);
      doSomething(value);
    }
  } finally {
    // It's safe to call ack multiple times since it's a no-op
    ack(false);
  }
}
```

# `WorkPool`

The callback execution pool that executes the limited number of callbacks in parallel while other submitted callbacks
wait in the queue.

```ts
// The pool that processes 5 callbacks in parallel at maximum
const pool = new WorkPool(5);

pool.submit(async signal => doSomething());
// â†’ Promise<ReturnType<typeof doSomething>>
```

You can change how many callbacks can the pool process in parallel:

```ts
pool.resize(2); // â†’ Promise<void>
```

`resize` returns the promise that is resolved when there are no excessive callbacks being processed in parallel.

If you resize the pool down, callbacks that are pending and exceed the new size limit, are notified via `signal` that
they must be aborted.

To abort all callbacks that are being processed by the pool and wait for their completion use:

```ts
// Resolved when all pending callbacks are fulfilled
pool.resize(0); // â†’ Promise<void>
```

# `Executor`

Manages async callback execution process and provides ways to access execution results, abort or replace an execution,
and subscribe to state changes.

Create an `Executor` instance and submit a callback for execution:

```ts
const executor = new Executor();

executor.execute(doSomething);
// â†’ Promise<void> | void
```

The `execute` method returns a promise if a passed callback is returns a promise, or `undefined` otherwise. The returned
promise is fulfilled when the promise returned from the callback is settled.

If there's a pending execution, it is aborted and the new execution is started.

To check that executor is currently executing a callback check
[`pending`](https://smikhalevski.github.io/parallel-universe/classes/Executor.html#pending).

After a promise returned from the executed callback is settled, the execution result (or rejection reason) are available
through [`result`](https://smikhalevski.github.io/parallel-universe/classes/Executor.html#result) and
[`reason`](https://smikhalevski.github.io/parallel-universe/classes/Executor.html#reason).

You can check whether the promise was
[`fulfilled`](https://smikhalevski.github.io/parallel-universe/classes/Executor.html#fulfilled),
[`rejected`](https://smikhalevski.github.io/parallel-universe/classes/Executor.html#rejected) or
[`settled`](https://smikhalevski.github.io/parallel-universe/classes/Executor.html#settled).

To abort the pending execution, you can use
an [abort signal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal)
passed to the executed callback:

```ts
executor.execute(async signal => {
  // Check signal.aborted
});

executor.abort();
```

When execution is aborted the current `result` and `reason` remain intact.

To reset the executor to the initial state use:

```ts
executor.clear();
```

You can directly fulfill or reject an executor:

```ts
executor.resolve(value);

executor.reject(reason);
```

Subscribe to an executor to receive notifications when its state changes:

```ts
const unsubscribe = executor.subscribe(() => {
  // Handle the update
});

unsubscribe();
```

# `Lock`

Promise-based [lock implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)).

When someone tries to acquire a `Lock` they receive a promise for a release callback that is resolved as soon as
previous lock owner invokes their release callback.

```ts
const lock = new Lock();

lock.acquire();
// â†’ Promise<() => void>
```

You can check that the lock is [`locked`](https://smikhalevski.github.io/parallel-universe/classes/Lock.html#locked)
before acquiring a lock.

For example, if you want to force an async callback executions to be sequential you can use ane external lock:

```ts
const lock = new Lock();

async function doSomething() {
  const release = await lock.acquire();
  try {
    // Long process is handled here
  } finally {
    release();
  }
}

// Long process would be executed three times sequentially
doSomething();
doSomething();
doSomething();
```

# `Blocker`

Provides a mechanism for blocking an async process and unblocking it from the outside.

```ts
const blocker = new Blocker<string>();

blocker.block();
// â†’ Promise<string>
```

You can later unblock it passing a value that would fulfill the promise returned from the `block` call:

```ts
blocker.unblock('Mars');
```

# `untilTruthy`

Returns a promise that is fulfilled when a callback returns a truthy value, or a promise that is fulfilled with a
truthy value.

```ts
untilTruthy(doSomeChecks);
// â†’ Promise<ReturnType<typeof doSomeChecks>>
```

If you don't want `untilTruthy` to invoke the callback too frequently, provide a delay in milliseconds:

```ts
untilTruthy(doSomeChecks, 1_000);
```

Instead of a fixed delay you can pass a function that returns a delay:

```ts
untilTruthy(
  doSomeChecks,
  asyncResult => asyncResult.rejected ? 1_000 : 0
);
```

If a callback starts an async process, you can use an
[abort signal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) to abort it later:

```ts
const abortController = new AbortController();

untilTruthy(signal => doSomeChecks(signal), 0, abortController.signal);

abortController.abort();
```

You can combine `untilTruthy` with [`timeout`](#timeout). For example, to poll a callback every 100 milliseconds until
it returns a truthy value or abort after 5 seconds:

```ts
timeout(
  signal => untilTruthy(doSomeChecks, 100, signal),
  5_000,
);
```

# `repeatUntil`

Much like a [`untilTruthy`](#untiltruthy) and provides more control when the callback polling is fulfilled.

```ts
repeatUntil(
  // The callback that is invoked repeatedly
  async signal => doSomething(),

  // The until clause must return true to stop the loop
  asyncResult => asyncResult.rejected,

  // Optional delay between callback invokations
  asyncResult => 100,
  // or just pass a literal number of milliseconds

  // Optional signal that can abort the loop from the outside
  abortController.signal,
);
// â†’ Promise<ReturnType<typeof doSomething>>
```

You can combine `repeatUntil` with [`timeout`](#timeout) to limit the repeat duration:

```ts
timeout(
  timeoutSignal =>
    repeatUntil(
      signal => doSomething(),
      asyncResult => asyncResult.fulfilled,
      100,
      timeoutSignal
    ),
  5000
);
// â†’ Promise<ReturnType<typeof doSomething>>
```

# `sleep`

Returns a promise that resolves after a timeout. If aborted via a passed signal then rejected with
an [`AbortError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMException#aborterror).

```ts
sleep(100, abortController.signal);
// â†’ Promise<undefined>
```

# `timeout`

Rejects with a [`TimeoutError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMException#timeouterror) if execution
time exceeds the timeout. If aborted via a passed signal then rejected with an
[`AbortError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMException#aborterror).

```ts
timeout(
  async signal => doSomething(),

  // Execution timeout
  100,

  // Optional signal that can abort the execution from the outside
  abortController.signal,
);
// â†’ Promise<ReturnType<typeof doSomething>>
```
