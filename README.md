# Usage

### `AsyncQueue`

Asynchronous queue decouples value providers and value consumers.

```ts
const queue = new AsyncQueue();

// Provider adds a value
queue.add('my value');

// Consumer takes a value when it becomes available
queue.take(); // â†’ Promise<"my value">
```

`queue.take()` removes the value from the queue when it becomes available. If there are no values in the queue
when `queue.take()` was called then the returned `Promise` would resolve after the next `queue.add()` call.

```ts
const queue = new AsyncQueue();

// The returned Promise would be resolved after the add call
queue.take(); // â†’ Promise<"my value">

queue.add("my value");
```

Consumers receive values from the queue in the same order they were added by providers:

```ts
const queue = new AsyncQueue();

queue.add('Missouri');
queue.add('Oregon');

queue.take(); // â†’ Promise<"Missouri">
queue.take(); // â†’ Promise<"Oregon">
```

Sometimes removing the values from the queue isn't a desirable behavior, since consumer may be in the state when it
cannot process it.

Protocol provides an available value and an acknowledgement callback. The consumer should call the acknowledgement callback
to notify the queue that it would process the value.

```ts
queue.takeAck().then(([value, ack]) => {
  ack();
  doSomething(value);
});
```

The acknowledgement callback can be used in a blocking and a non-blocking manner. If `ackRequired` is `true` then
queue consumers would be blocked until `ack` is called. Otherwise, the acknowledgement would be automatically
revoked on _the next tick_ after returned `AckProtocol` `Promise` is resolved and value would remain in
the queue.

```ts
queue.takeAck(true).then(([value, ack]) => {
  ack(true);
  doSomething(value);
});
```

If value consumer may not be able to process the value when it was taken, you should use `takeAck`.

`takeAck` returns a `Promise` that resolves with an acknowledgement callback that returns a value. The acknowledgement
callback dequeues a value and returns it; all subsequent invocations of the acknowledgement callback would return the
same value.

```ts
queue.takeAck().then((ack) => {
  const value = ack();
});
```

The acknowledgement callback must be either ignored or called on _the next tick_ after the returned `Promise` is
resolved, otherwise it is revoked and would throw an error.

```ts
queue.takeAck()
    .then(() => undefined) // Skip the tick
    .then((ack) => {
      ack(); // â†’ throws an Error
    });
```

### `Pool`

The callback execution pool that can execute limited number of callbacks in parallel while other submitted callbacks
wait in the queue.

```ts
// Pool that proceesses 5 callbacks in parallel at maximum
const pool = new Pool(5);

pool.submit(async () => doSomething());
// â†’ Promise<ReturnType<typeof doSomething>>

// Change how many callback can the pool process in parallel
pool.resize(2);
// â†’ Promise<void>
```

If you resize the pool down, some callbacks that are pending may be aborted via `signal.aborted`.
`Pool.resize` returns the `Promise` that is resolved when there are no excessive are being processed in parallel.

### `Blocker`

Provides mechanism for blocking async processes and unblocking them from an external context.

```ts
const blocker = new Blocker();

async function doSomething() {
  const value = await blocker.block();
  // â†’ "my value"
}

doSomething();

blocker.unblock('my value');
```

### `Lock`

Promise-based [lock implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)).

When someone tries to acquire a `Lock` they receive a `Promise` for a release callback that is resolved as soon as
previous lock owner invokes their release callback.

```ts
const lock = new Lock();

async function doSomething() {
  const release = await lock.acquire();
  try {
    // Long process starts here
  } finally {
    release();
  }
}

// Long process would be executed three times sequentially
doSomething();
doSomething();
doSomething();
```

### `Executor`

Manages async callback execution process and provides ways to access execution results, abort or replace an execution,
and subscribe to state changes.

```ts
const executor = new Executor();

executor.execute(async (signal) => doSomething());
// â†’ Promise<void>

executor.pending;
// â†’ true

// Aborts pending execution
executor.abort();
```

### `repeatUntil`

Invokes a callback periodically with the given delay between resolutions of the returned `Promise`.

```ts
repeatUntil(
    // The callback that is invoked repeatedly
    async (signal) => doSomething(),

    // The until clause must return true to stop the loop
    (asyncResult) => asyncResult.rejected,

    // Optional delay between callback invokations
    100,
    // or
    // (asyncResult) => 100,

    // Optional signal that can abort the loop from the outside
    abortController.signal,
);
// â†’ Promise<ReturnType<typeof doSomething>>
```

### `sleep`

Returns a promise that resolves after a timeout. If aborted via a passed signal then rejected with an `AbortError`.

```ts
sleep(100, abortController.signal);
// â†’ Promise<undefined>
```

### `timeout`

Rejects with a `TimeoutError` if execution time exceeds the timeout. If aborted via a passed signal then rejected with
an `AbortError`.

```ts
timeout(
    async (signal) => doSomething(),
    // or
    // doSomething()

    // Execution timeout
    100,

    // Optional signal that can abort the execution from the outside
    abortController.signal,
);
// â†’ Promise<ReturnType<typeof doSomething>>
```
